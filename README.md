# digitalsolitude

*a website for one person only*

---

## concept

digitalsolitude explores the paradox of solitude in our hyperconnected age. the website exists as a deliberate refusal of the internet's fundamental assumption: infinite scalability.

when a second visitor attempts to access the site, it disappears. the server fades away. the experience dissolves.

this is not a bug. this is the art.

---

## installation

```
npm install
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

the website will be available at `localhost:3000`

---

## how it works

```
visitor_count = 0

if visitor_count > 1:
    disappear()
    recreate_after_3_seconds()
else:
    serve_solitude()
```

## artist statement

in 1995, the internet promised connection. today it delivers surveillance capitalism dressed as community.

digitalsolitude is a small rebellion: a website that demands presence, attention, solitude. it cannot be consumed by masses. it cannot be optimized for engagement. it can only be experienced by one person at a time.

when you visit alone, the entire website is yours. when someone else tries to join, it dissolves. this dissolution is not failureâ€”it is feature. it is poetry written in server disappearances and gentle timeouts.
